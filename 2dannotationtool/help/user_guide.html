        <h2 id="10110">Introduction</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> Mammogram Annotation Tool allows you to interactively annotate mammographic images.
        </p></div>
        
        <h2 id="10111">Opening a set of studies</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                You can open a set of studies to be annotated by navigating to the main graphical user interface window 
                drop down menu 'File' and choosing 'Open'. From the following dialog you then choose a CSV file 
                containing the StudyInstanceUID's corresponding to the mammogram image locations (folders on your hard drive).
        </p></div>
        
        <h2 id="10112">Inverting image</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                You can invert (complement) an image by pressing the key 'i' when the main user interface, one of the 
                mammographic views or the mammographic information window is active. Both views are inverted when the 
                key 'i' is pressed.
        </p></div>
               
        <h2 id="10113">Window/level</h2>
               
        <div><p>
                You can adjust brightness and contrast by keeping the right mouse button down and dragging the mouse 
                (horizontal movement, brightness; vertical movement, contrast). Window/level mouse pointer should 
                appear. In medical applications, brightness/contrast adjustment is often referred as adjusting the 
                window/level.
        </p></div>
        
        <h2 id="10114">Zoom in / zoom out</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                You can zoom in / zoom out the image by using the mouse wheel. Initial setting is restored when clicking 
                the mouse wheel or pressing the key 'z'. 
        </p></div>
        
        <h2 id="10115">Image panning</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                Panning the image is available when the image has been zoomed in by keeping the left mouse button down and 
                dragging the mouse. Hand shaped mouse pointer should appear.
        </p></div>
        
        <h2 id="10116">Switching between mammographic views</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                As default, you are shown the cranio-caudal (CC) view of right and left side mammograms. You can switch 
                between cranio-caudal (CC) and medio-lateral oblique (MLO) view by pressing the key 'v'.
        </p></div>
        
        <h2 id="10117">Navigating between studies</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                You can move between the the different studies by pressing the keys 'right arrow' (next study) or 
                'left arrow' (previous study).
        </p></div>
        
        <div><p>
                You can also open a list including all studies listed in your CSV study information file by 
                navigating to the main graphical user interface window drop down menu 'View' and 
                choosing 'Study list'. An additional GUI window should appear showing a table of studies to
                annotate and their annotation status. Choosing a specific study to annotate is done by
                clicking the corresponding StudyInstanceUID.
        </p></div>
        
        <h2 id="10119">Creating and removing annotations</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                There is a freehand tool for drawing a region of interest. You can create annotation by first 
                pressing one of the function keys F1 (malignant mass), F2 (benign mass), F3 (malignant calcification), 
                F4 (benign calcification), and F5 and F6 (malignant and benign architectural distortion) and drawing 
                a freehand region of interest (ROI) by holding down left mouse button. 
                Drawing the ROI can be cancelled before releasing left mouse button by pressing the key 'ESC'. To finish the 
                ROI, release the mouse button. ROI shape should appear.
        </p></div>
        
        <div><p>
                Annotations can be removed by first pressing the key 'r' and then selecting the ROI to be removed by left 
                mouse click inside the ROI area using the crosshair which should appear. In case of overlapping annotations,
                all annotations sharing the specified coordinates will be removed.
                Removing an annotation using the crosshair can be cancelled by pressing the key 'ESC' at any 
                time before choosing any of the ROI masks.
        </p></div>
        
        <div><p>
                Visualizing the annotations is automatic (certain color shape should appear).
        </p></div>
        
        <h2 id="10120">Saving results</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                Saving the annotations and other user inputed data is automatic, but it can be forced by pressing the 
                keys 'Ctrl + S' or navigating to the main graphical user interface window drop down menu 'File' and 
                choosing 'Save'.
        </p></div>
